            Loss of productivity can easily be avoided by performing the right analysis of user groups, identifying key stakeholders and compilation of requirements before starting a project. Requirement analysis comes in parallel with a technical exploration phase. The combination of a strong technical background with the right functional expertise can lead to the ultimate architecture for a tailored solution.
